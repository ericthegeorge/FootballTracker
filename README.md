# FootballTracker

A project by Eric George, Roko Condic, and Bassel Hasan. It will track professional football teams and players and they're data, presenting them in a fun and fan-oriented manner.

# Setup

## Installing Django

Assuming you have python installed, which is the base language for Django, you can run the following commands in terminal:

`pip install django`
`pip install djangorestframework`
`pip install mysqlclient`
`pip install python-dotenv`

Next, open your MySQL workbench. If you don't have it installed already, you can install it [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/).

### Creating Your Database
If this is you're first time with MySQL, you'll need to create a local instance connection that you'll work on. The names here don't really matter, the databases are 'schemas' here. You can create it with the default settings, with any name you wish (Local Instance, loc, ROKOROKOROKOandapinchofBassel). It should look something like this in setup:

Once you're in, create the schema for our FootballTracker database. Right-click in the schema's section to select the 'Create Schema' option, and give it a name with the default options.

### Adding Your Environment Variables
Once this is done, you'll want to head back over to our code in your IDE. Create your own .env file (explicity just '.env') in the Backend folder, beside manage.py and the footballtracker folder.

This is personal information, so it's added to the gitignore and will not be committed into the repository. Add your details here like so:

`
DB_NAME= THE_name_WOW`
`DB_USER=root`
`DB_PASSWORD=perhapsthereisapasswordhereperhaps`
`DB_HOST= 127.0.0.1`
`DB_PORT= 3306
`

This allows each of us to maintain our local instance of the database, without interfering with each other's configurations. Since we're only deploying locally for a test, this is the easiest way to go for now. We can consider database sharing later, as it isn't relevant to development right now. If need be for some test data, we can send the csv's (or other file formats) to share the data.

Finally, you're going to run the following commands in your terminal (in the root folder of "FootballTracker/Backend"):

`python manage.py makemigrations`
`python manage.py migrate`

This will setup Django's authentication models in our schema.

### Further Information on Django

Most of the backend functionality for local deployment will come from running some arguments on manage.py. The manage.py file is what calls the code, and we do actions by giving it the proper args (in command line), like makemigrations or runserver. Below are some important Django commands.

`python manage.py runserver`

Starts a lightweight development web server on the local machine. By default, the server runs on the IP address 127.0.0.1. You can pass in an IP address and port number explicitly. Use this when you want to test (locally).

`python manage.py makemigrations`

Creates new migrations based on the changes detected to your models. Migrations, their relationship with apps and more are covered in depth in the migrations documentation in the link below. Models are essentially tables from our database.  We interact with them through the Models we create in Django.

`python manage.py migrate`

Synchronizes the database state with the current set of models and migrations. Migrations, their relationship with apps and more are covered in depth in the migrations documentation in the link below.

[Django/Python documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/django-admin/) (the commands differ, but generally use the name as the cmd line argument for manage.py).

## Installing Flutter

The first thing you'll need to do is install Flutter and it's SDK in your device and IDE of choice. You can do this by following the instructions [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows/web) (this is the web-app configuration of flutter installation).

Note: If adding it to your path environment doesn't apply properly, try using the absolute path instead of the %USERPROFILE%
based one.

At this point, you may need to close and reopen your IDE for it to reload your terminal (and thereby recognize flutter commands). You can check if Flutter is recognized with a simple version commmand:
`flutter doctor --version`

If it works, you're all ready for development!

### Further Information on Flutter

You can find general documentation for Flutter at: https://docs.flutter.dev/ \
Detailed API documentation is available at: https://api.flutter.dev/ \

# Other Notes

We should update this readme if anyone finds issues with setup or development, or finds anything else to contribute. It's important we do this so the information is shared and we can work efficiently. It's like commenting but 10x better (worse). But it's important ðŸ˜­. Hopefully the setup goes smoothly for everyone. Development is the fun part so let's enjoy it! ðŸ™Œ
